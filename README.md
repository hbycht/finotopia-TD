# finotopia-TD
Finotopia is an intuitive, semi-automatic open-source control system for DMX devices and event lighting designed for sound-reactive work in sound spaces with TouchDesigner.

It was published by [Henning Brode](https://www.henningbrode.de) in January 2026 as part of his bachelor's thesis «Light in Sound – Space: Development of an open-source lighting control system for automating lighting design in sound spaces» in the [Code & Context](https://coco.study) study program at TH Köln.
